# Programming Language Direction

There are several things going in the community, but I might not involued that much, so I think I should create something for me to get deep into it.

## My Programming Experience.
I have experience with multiple programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Basic, Java, Python, Node, Ruby, JavaScript, and TypeScript. However, I believe it's important to focus on a select few. Although it's easy to set up a basic "hello world" application with CRUD functionality, more advanced topics like plugins and libraries can take a significant amount of time to become familiar with and keep up with as the community and new features for each language are constantly evolving.

It is noteworthy that many job postings, even for new start-up companies which may have limited funding, require knowledge of multiple programming languages. This raises concerns about the proficiency. The poor job descriptions may be confusing for junior engineers or students trying to choose a specific career path.
